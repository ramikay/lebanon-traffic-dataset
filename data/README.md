## Instructions

The easiest way to import this package is using one of the existing [Data Package Tools](http://frictionlessdata.io/tooling/data-package-tools).

You can also manually ingest the package resources, which is composed from 2 files:

- **`data/streets.geojson`**: list of street features referenced in `data/velocities.csv` described in [`GeoJSON`](https://geojson.org/).
- **`data/velocities.csv`**: location and velocity data of devices in automotive transport, confined to the country of Lebanon.

| Field                 | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Date                  | `date`     | Date of when the data point was collected. Date values are reported in `Asia/Beirut` timezone. Values range between `2015-03-20` and `2019-10-17`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Time                  | `time`     | Time of when the data point was collected. Time values are reported in `Asia/Beirut` timezone. Values range between `00:00:00` and `23:59:59`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Coordinate (Lon, Lat) | `geopoint` | Coordinate of where the data point was collected. Coordinates are represented as `(longitude,latitude)`, and NOT `(latitude,longitude)`. Latitude values range between `-90` and `90`. Longitude values range between `-180` and `180`.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Course                | `number`   | The direction in which the device was traveling when the data point was collected, measured in degrees starting at due north and continue clockwise around the compass. Thus, north is 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, and so on. Course values may not be available on all devices. A negative value indicates that the course information is invalid. Values range between `0` and `360`. |
| Velocity              | `number`   | The velocity the device was traveling at when the data point was collected, measured in meters/second NOT kilometers/hour. Values are positive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Street ID             | `string`   | The unique identifier for the street using its OpenStreetMap (OSM) ID. Streets are map-matched from OSM with a simple linear algebra algorithm using the device's coordinate and course.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
